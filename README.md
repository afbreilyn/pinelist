# Pinelist

Pinelist, for now, just says "hello world"!

It is built on Kotlin & React.

[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) for component tests, [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for integration tests, along with some [groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/testing.html) contract tests
